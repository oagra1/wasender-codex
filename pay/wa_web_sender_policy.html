    <h1>WA Web Sender Private Policy</h1>
    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>Like most website operators, WA Web Sender collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. WA Web Sender's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how WA Web Sender's visitors use its website. From time to time, WA Web Sender may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
    <p>WA Web Sender also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blog. WA Web Sender only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Certain visitors to WA Web Sender's Website choose to interact with WA Web Sender in ways that require WA Web Sender to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that WA Web Sender gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with WA Web Sender are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, WA Web Sender collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with WA Web Sender. WA Web Sender does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
    <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
    <p>WA Web Sender may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. WA Web Sender may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, WA Web Sender does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
    <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>WA Web Sender discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on WA Web Sender's behalf or to provide services available at WA Web Sender's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using WA Web Sender's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. WA Web Sender will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, WA Web Sender discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when WA Web Sender believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of WA Web Sender, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a WA Web Sender website and have supplied your email address, WA Web Sender may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with WA Web Sender and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. WA Web Sender takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

    <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
    <p>If WA Web Sender, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that WA Web Sender goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
